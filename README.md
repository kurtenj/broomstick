# Broomstick App

**Broomstick** is a lightweight tool for running *design sweeps* — quick visual reviews of implemented designs, where designers log feedback for developers to fix or polish. Each sweep is a checklist of todos, with optional screenshots and public sharing for fast iteration.

Think of it as a clipboard-powered bug tracker built for speed.

## Features

- Create sweeps with or without titles  
- Add feedback items as simple todos  
- Paste screenshots directly from your clipboard (auto-compressed on upload)  
- Share sweeps via public links — no login needed to mark items complete  
- Let developers or stakeholders check off items as they’re resolved  
- Manage your active sweeps from a personal dashboard  
- Rename sweeps inline  
- Delete old sweeps when the round is done  
- Sign in with Google or GitHub  
- Admin panel to manage and invite users  
- Fully responsive — works great on mobile and desktop  

## How to Use

1. **Start a Sweep**  
   Create a new sweep for the current design review round.

2. **Log Feedback**  
   Add todos for anything that needs fixing or refinement.

3. **Paste Screenshots**  
   Take screenshots using your OS tool — then paste (`⌘+V` / `Ctrl+V`) directly into the todo field. Images are compressed client-side for quick upload.

4. **Share with Devs**  
   Send the sweep’s public link to your developer or team. They’ll see the list and can mark items complete — no account needed.

5. **Track & Wrap Up**  
   Monitor progress from your dashboard. When everything’s resolved, delete the sweep and move on.
